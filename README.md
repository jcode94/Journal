# Journal
This is a Python Journal Script for Windows to append information to a DirTree.

# Project Summary:
 command-line prompt for entering information that is appended to a day-specific .txt
 file at a designated location.

# IMPORTANT!
The python script was written and tested on a Windows 10 system and no other. 
Additionally, because the script checks for cwd at init, it is recommended that 
you call the file from the default location of command prompt. 

# Looking Ahead:
The search function currently has no implementation and simply returns a makeshift 
'Out of Order' message. 

I plan to have it:
1. Search by:
   [year, month, day(of the month or week), time span(between a and b)]
2. Filter by:
   [date, time of day, other words in text]
   
I have no knowledge of how to search through files but plan to learn and implement 
at least a basic functionality on or before 6.25.2020 to allow for at minimum a single 
keyword search.
