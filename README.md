# Journal
This is a Python Journal Script for Windows to append information to a DirTree.


# Project Summary:
 command-line prompt for entering information that is appended to a day-specific .txt
 file at a designated location.

# IMPORTANT!
The python script was written and tested on a Windows 10 system and no other. 
Additionally, because the script checks for cwd at init, it is recommended that 
you call the file from the default location of command prompt.
